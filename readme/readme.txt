*** Programming for artits ***

Welcome!

eebood is an online coding resource for the processing programming language -
[http://processing.org]. 

This site is made up of actual Processing sketches.
it is a simple way of tinkering and playing around with processing code. 

it uses Processingjs [.org] for viewing sketches in the browser - 
so be sure your skectch is able to run in javascript mode. 

You can execute a sketch by pressing the "Run sketch" button in the toolbar
and kill it using the "Stop sketch" button. 

This site is in early development and is meant for internal use (for now:)
For any queries please contact lior - soogbet@gmail.com

Enjoy!
